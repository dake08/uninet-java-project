# Uninet-Intranet Java-project
Intranet is a general system created for teachers and
students. Students can register for a course, use course files,
track their attendance, see grades, schedule, and exam
dates. Teachers can manage the course, send files, assign
grades and change them, see the list of their students. The
intranet makes all processes convenient for everyone.
